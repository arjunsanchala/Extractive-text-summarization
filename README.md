# Extractive-text-summarization
A complete methodology to create a text summarizer using Natural language processing.  

## Introduction
The project goal is to explore natural language field and explore NLTK library provided by python. In addition, Times of india's article has been used by web scrapping to generate summaries. At the end, I am attaching the research paper written by me, to understand how graph-based algorithm works and how we can use these algorithm to make an extractive text summarizer.

## Requirements
Python, understanding of Natural Language processing and web scrapping, understanding of graph-based algorithms.
